        <h2>Privacy policy</h2>

        <p class="lead">
          Lemon Squeezy does not track you. We do not collect, store, sell, or share personal data.
        </p>

        <h3>What we collect</h3>
        <p>
          Nothing. Lemon Squeezy does not require an account, does not connect to servers,
          and does not integrate third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking.
        </p>

        <h3>Device permissions</h3>
        <p>
          Lemon Squeezy requests the following permissions solely to provide core functionality:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Camera</strong> – required to take photos.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Photo library</strong> – required to save photos to your camera roll. (Optional)
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Where your photos go</h3>
        <p>
          Photos you take remain in the app, unless you explicitly choose to save them to your camera roll. We do not upload your photos anywhere.
        </p>

        <h3>Changes to this policy</h3>
        <p>
          If we ever change how the app handles data, we will update this page and adjust the effective date above.

      <section id="terms">
        <h2>Terms of use</h2>

        <h3>1. Who we are</h3>
        <p>
          Lemon Squeezy (“we”, “us”) is provided by app developer <strong>Tom Rolfe</strong>. These terms govern your use of
          the Lemon Squeezy app.
        </p>

        <h3>2. License</h3>
        <p>
          We grant you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use Lemon Squeezy for your own
          non-commercial purposes, subject to these terms and any applicable app store rules. You retain all rights to photos you take. 
        </p>

        <h3>3. Acceptable use</h3>
        <p>
          You agree not to misuse the app, attempt to interfere with its normal operation, reverse engineer it where
          prohibited by law, or use it in a way that violates any applicable laws or regulations.
        </p>


        <h3>4. Payments</h3>
<p>
  Lemon Squeezy may offer optional in-app purchases, including subscriptions and a one-time
  “lifetime” purchase. All payments are processed by Apple via your App Store account.
  We do not collect or store your payment details.
</p>
<p>
  Subscriptions automatically renew unless cancelled through your App Store account
  settings. The “lifetime” purchase grants ongoing access to the features included at
  the time of purchase, for as long as the app is available and supported.
</p>
<p>
  Refunds, cancellations, and billing disputes are handled according to Apple’s policies.
</p>


        <h3>5. Disclaimers</h3>
        <p>
          Lemon Squeezy is provided “as is” and “as available”. While we aim for a reliable experience, we do not
          guarantee that the app will be uninterrupted or error-free. We may update the app over time (for example, to add features, improve stability, or address security issues).
          We may also modify or discontinue features at any time.
        </p>

        <h3>6. Limitation of liability</h3>
        <p>
          To the maximum extent permitted by law, we will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special,
          consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of data, profits, or goodwill arising from your use of the app.
          Nothing in these terms limits any liability that cannot legally be limited.
        </p>

        <h3>7. Governing law</h3>
        <p>
          These terms are governed by the laws of <strong>England and Wales</strong>, and the courts of England and Wales
          will have jurisdiction, except where mandatory local consumer laws apply.
