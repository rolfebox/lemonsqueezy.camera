          <h2>Designed for tiny photographers</h2>
          <p class="section-intro">
            Lemon Squeezy is ultra basic by design – you won't find stickers or filters or funny effects here. Just a handful of smart features powered by common sense.
          </p>

          <article class="feature">
            <h3>Ease of use</h3>
            <p>
              The camera screen is stripped down to the bare essentials, with a shutter that’s easy to press and an optional delay between snaps to reduce rapid-fire duplicates. There are no complex modes and no distractions in sight.
            </p>

          <article class="feature">
            <h3>A safe store</h3>
            <p>
              Apple’s Camera app makes it far too easy for kids to wander into your whole photo library and share whatever they find with one accidental tap. Lemon Squeezy keeps their snaps separate in their own safe gallery, so they can review their photos without scrolling through yours.
            </p>
          </article>

          <article class="feature">
            <h3>Set your limits</h3>
            <p>
              Set an optional daily photo limit and the app will keep track. Kids can count the pips to see how many photos are left, and the camera automatically shuts off when they reach the limit.
            </p>
          </article>

          <article class="feature">
            <h3>Extra juicy extras</h3>
            <p>
              View your kids latest snaps from the Lemon Squeezy gallery widget. Get one-tap access when you need it most with Lock Screen controls. Customize the look of the app with vibrant themes. Adjust the photo quality to save storage or prepare for print, depending on your needs.
            </p>
            <p class="fineprint">* Available with Lemon Squeezy Pro from just $1/£1.</p>

          <details class="faq" open>
            <summary>Why wouldn't I just use the default Camera app?</summary>
            <p>
              Apple's Camera is great – for grown-ups. But it's hard for kids to use, grants inadvertent access to your entire photo library, and the photos take up lots of space on device and in iCloud. Lemon Squeezy solves all those problem, and more.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details class="faq">
            <summary>Who made Lemon Squeezy?</summary>
            <p>
              Me! An actual person, not a faceless bloodsucking corporate entity. My name is Tom and I'm a dad of two amazing girls who inspired this app and helped me stress-test it. I built this app as a passion project between nap times and I hope you like it.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details class="faq">
            <summary>Is the app free?</summary>
            <p>
              The core experience is completely free, forever. No ads, limits, or shady upsell screens. A small paid upgrade unlocks some nice extras, including widgets, quick access controls, themes, and quality settings. It also helps support future development of the app!
